# LD44: Universal Blood Supply

Universal Blood Supply is my take on [Ludum Dare's 44th Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44/theme) theme: *Your life is currency.*

I intended this to be a slight rip on the classic [Universal Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/), but for now I've shelved the project because it required considerably more development and effort than I originally anticipated.  Eventually, I hope to have the time to come back and really fully develop the game.  Unlike Universal Paperclips, I'd like to include multiple endings that can be reached by pursuing different researches.

For now, you require Pygame to run this game in Python3.7, (though I imagine an older Python3 will still work.)
